[Max projects](https://docs.cycling74.com/max8/vignettes/projects_topic) for starting a [Max for Live](https://www.ableton.com/en/live/max-for-live/) device. 

These blank projects were originally created for my Electronic Music & Sound Design course at Stetson University.
Throughout the course, I try to reinforce three categories across every piece of software & hardware we look at during the semester: Control, Sythesis & Sampling, & Processing.
These categories map nicely onto the three types of Live devices:

* Control = MIDI effect
* Sythesis & Sampling = Instrument
* Processing = Audio effect

When we get to our unit on Max, their project eventually has to be handed in as a Max for Device device.
There are several benefits to enforcing this standardization early in their Max training.
First and most important is that their project is ready to use in Ableton Live, which we cover earlier in the semester. 
Second, they have to develop good naming habits for parameters, otherwise things like automation may not work.
Third, ambitious students can take a few extra steps and share their Max for Live device with [the wider user community](https://maxforlive.com).
